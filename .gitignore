# pipenv
#   According to pypa/pipenv#598,
 it is recommended to include Pipfile.lock in version control.
#   However,
 in case of collaboration,
 if having platform-specific dependencies or dependencies
#   having no cross-platform support,
 pipenv may install dependencies that don't work,
 or not
#   install all needed dependencies.
